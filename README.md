# Keystroke Dynamics Classification
The dataset for the Classification has been created from scratch, taking in consideration features like, letter, group, inter-group latency, press latency, release latency and hold latency.
1. Group: This is predetermined for a bunch of keys having something common in the way of their typing, usage, frquency, etc.
2. Inter-group latency: Time taken between pressing two keys, each from different groups.
